# Employee Sorting Project

## Overview

This project is about managing a list of employees in Java and learning how to sort them in different ways.

---

I created an `Employee` class to represent each employee with their **name, age, and salary**. I added a constructor to easily create employee objects and a `toString()` method so their details could be displayed clearly when printing.

Next, I made a list of employees using **ArrayList** and added several employees with different names, ages, and salaries. After that, I sorted the employees in two ways:

1. **By salary, from highest to lowest** – so that the employee earning the most appears first.
2. **By name, in alphabetical order** – so that the employees are listed from A to Z.

I printed the lists after each sort to check that the order was correct.

Through this project, I got hands-on experience with **Java collections**, **custom sorting using Comparators**, and working with objects in a list. It helped me understand how to organize data and display it in a meaningful way.

If you want, I can also make a **short, crisp version perfect for a GitHub portfolio** that reads like a project summary anyone can understand.

Do you want me to do that?
